# AMItest-derived scenario subset

Seven actual audio windows / case-local RTTMs / full-duration UEMs: six **primary, nonduplicated** 16-kHz mono Mix-Headset windows from six meetings plus a **dependent microphone pair** of the overlap window from single distant Array1-01. This is **not a full AMI/test benchmark score**. Each window starts a fresh inference session and a fresh local recording ID at time zero; speaker identity is evaluated *within* its window only. EN2002a/b/c/d are four meetings from the same EN2002 session, so speakers may recur across cases: the six windows are not six statistically independent participant groups. The 600-second long-context window is one contiguous, uninterrupted inference session, not concatenated turns. The far-field result is separate from the six-case aggregate because it shares exactly the same meeting/time/reference as `overlap_heavy`.

| Case | Meeting: source window (s) | Length (s) | Speakers | Annotated overlap (s) | Annotation-derived condition |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| low_overlap | IS1009b: 440–560 | 120 | 3 | 0 | 0% overlap / 103.205 s speech |
| rapid_turn_taking | EN2002d: 1320–1440 | 120 | 4 | 38.316 | 85 distinct-speaker changes in 96 grouped turns |
| overlap_heavy | EN2002a: 1890–2010 | 120 | 4 | 30.801 | 33.97% of annotated speech has at least two speakers |
| long_return_gap | ES2004b: 150–330 | 180 | 4 | 3.393 | ES2004b.D speaks 21.034–25.764 and 169.742–175.282 s; 143.978-s return gap with 93.632 s of intervening other-speaker speech (3 speakers) |
| brief_interjections | EN2002b: 280–400 | 120 | 4 | 21.589 | 38 grouped turns <=0.7 s |
| long_context | EN2002c: 1970–2570 | 600 | 3 | 85.553 | 600 continuous seconds; 232 distinct-speaker changes |
| far_field_pair | EN2002a: 1890–2010 | 120 | 4 | 30.801 | same window as overlap_heavy; Array1-01 only |

Selection: `python3 select.py` reads **all 16** publisher `AMI/test` source RTTMs (inventory/hashes in `references/source_inventory.json`, meeting annotation spans and selected statistics in `selection.json`). Evaluate windows on a 10-second grid, excluding windows with fewer than three speakers or <40% annotated speech. Choose six distinct meetings sequentially by minimum overlap (<=3%), maximum distinct-speaker changes, maximum overlap fraction (>=12%), maximum **qualified** return gap (>=60 s), maximum grouped <=0.7 s turns (>=8), then maximum distinct-speaker changes over 600 s. A qualified return requires the same speaker's before/after turns >=1 s each, each entirely >1 s inside window, with >=20 s of intervening other-speaker annotations; the longest event with speaker/times/other-speech evidence is in `selection.json`. Tie-break by measured secondary feature, meeting ID, start time. For selection *only*, consecutive same-speaker RTTM intervals separated by <=0.6 s are grouped into turns. Speech and concurrent speech are computed directly from original intervals, never by bridging gaps. The reference RTTM is **never** grouped/smoothed. Selected case values and candidate counts are frozen in `selection.json` and source hashes in `manifest.json`. Scenario names are descriptive annotation features; rapid turns can also contain significant overlap and should not be treated as controlled factors. No predictions were used for selection.

## Reproduce locally

From repository root (Linux or WSL; `python3` and network access for downloading):

```sh
python3 experiments/ami_benchmark/fetch_references.py
python3 experiments/ami_benchmark/select.py
python3 experiments/ami_benchmark/fetch_audio.py
python3 experiments/ami_benchmark/fetch_far_field.py
python3 experiments/ami_benchmark/build.py
python3 experiments/ami_benchmark/crosscheck_audio.py
```

The first command obtains only 16 pinned textual RTTMs. `fetch_audio.py` downloads only the six selected full-length Mix-Headset WAVs from a [pinned CC BY 4.0 mirror](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ggfox00000/dia-AMICorpus-all) (full-file byte length and mirror LFS SHA-256 checked, official per-meeting URLs recorded). `fetch_far_field.py` downloads only the selected 120-s **Array1-01** PCM range from the [official source WAV](https://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/AMICorpusMirror/amicorpus/EN2002a/audio/EN2002a.Array1-01.wav) using verified Content-Range responses; source WAV header/sample count/byte offsets and range hashes are recorded, and it does not download unrelated AMI files. Official full-WAV direct streaming repeatedly stalled, so the six complete headset recordings use the pinned mirror and the distant-mic case uses authenticated official byte-range requests. `crosscheck_audio.py` independently fetches the official WAV header and three nontrivial 8-KiB PCM blocks at deterministic start/middle/end portions of **each of the six primary windows**; it compares official format/full recording data length and all block bytes to the pinned complete mirror files. Exact offsets, URLs, expected/observed SHA-256 and pass/fail are in `official_audio_crosscheck.json`. Such **spot checks plus full mirror hash are not proof of full bitwise official WAV identity**. Originals/range PCM are ignored under `source_audio/`. `build.py` requires exact 16-kHz mono PCM s16le, complete source window and matching reference/source hashes, then extracts original sample indices without resampling, interpolation, VAD or silence deletion. Clips live in ignored `audio/`; locally present WAVs are required, not synthesized by scoring. `manifest.json` pins source/clip audio SHA-256, clip PCM SHA-256, source/cropped RTTM and UEM SHA-256 and portable relative paths. Repeat `build.py` to verify byte-for-byte deterministic artifacts; it refuses changed published manifests.

All reference files, source attribution and small selected labels are tracked; raw official audio and 16-kHz WAV clips are intentionally **not** tracked (download with commands above). Do not redistribute source audio or labels without complying with [attribution and CC BY 4.0 terms](ATTRIBUTION.md). Source RTTM uses third-party forced alignment of `only_words` annotations, not manually inspected transcript/video; errors and non-word vocalizations can affect measured DER. Provenance is at the exact source URL and revision, not assumed interchangeable with other AMI diarization splits.

## Score predictions

Create a directory containing exactly one `<case-id>.rttm` per published manifest case. Required RTTM `SPEAKER` lines have ten standard fields and case-local time 0..duration; `SPEAKER low_overlap 1 0.250 1.100 <NA> <NA> predicted_1 <NA> <NA>` is an example format only, **not a benchmark prediction**. Multiple speakers can share time and speaker ID strings need not match reference IDs. An explicitly empty file means a completed run reporting no speech; **a missing file, wrong recording ID, invalid interval, or out-of-bounds timestamp is an error**. The corrected hypotheses are Soniox official SDK speaker-grouped segments, Qwen native utterances, and Nemotron native speaker-activity segments. They are scored as declared end-to-end system outputs, not pure voice-ID or word accuracy. Audio is supplied to inference; reference annotations, true speaker labels and known speaker counts are not.

Soniox grouping uses the pinned official `@soniox/node@2.3.0` function `segmentTranscript(tokens, {group_by: ['speaker']})` in provider time before mapping to source time. A group follows input token order and spans the first defined start to the last defined end; A→B→A remains three runs. No reference-based alignment, extra VAD, gap threshold, endpoint/finalize split or timestamp correction is applied. SDK grouping can bridge silence between same-speaker tokens; that time stays in the hypothesis and may count as false alarm. This expressly supersedes the earlier token-pulse-only support policy, which was unsuitable for the intended voice-recognition interpretation.

Projection intersects the declared segments with actual source-audio support and the clip UEM: wholly outside spans are excluded, straddling spans are clipped, and original timestamps plus diagnostics are retained. Padding is not speech evidence, unattributed output receives no invented speaker ID, and the strict scorer still rejects malformed or out-of-bounds serialized RTTMs. In-window provider timing errors, including the observed unresolved forced-finalization drift, remain errors rather than being shifted to match the reference.

Use a local isolated scorer environment (no credentials or model downloads):

```sh
python3 -m venv experiments/ami_benchmark/.venv
experiments/ami_benchmark/.venv/bin/pip install 'pyannote.metrics==4.0.0' 'typing_extensions==4.15.0'
experiments/ami_benchmark/.venv/bin/python experiments/ami_benchmark/score.py --predictions YOUR_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY --output YOUR_RESULTS.json
```

The standard `pyannote.metrics` diarization error rate computes optimal permutation/mapping, collar 0, **includes overlap**, and scores UEM [0,duration], including silence. Per-case miss, false alarm, speaker confusion, total speaker-time and DER are included; aggregate DER is pooled speaker-time, not averaged percentages. Speaker-count accuracy/MAE are supplemental. JSON `independent_six` means six **nonduplicated primary audio windows**, not independent speakers/participant groups; the paired-array aggregate is separate.

## Local CPU Nemotron check

With previously installed official pinned Nemotron Transformers runner and model weights under `experiments/diarization_comparison/nemotron/.venv` and `.cache/hf` (see its `report.md`):

```sh
HF_HOME=experiments/diarization_comparison/nemotron/.cache/hf HF_HUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1 TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false experiments/diarization_comparison/nemotron/.venv/bin/python experiments/ami_benchmark/run_nemotron.py
experiments/ami_benchmark/.venv/bin/python experiments/ami_benchmark/score.py --predictions experiments/ami_benchmark/predictions/nemotron_ultra_low_latency --output experiments/ami_benchmark/nemotron_ultra_low_latency_score.json
```

Runner uses the pinned NVIDIA checkpoint and official `ultra_low_latency` preset (0.32-s *nominal input buffer*, not measured live end-to-end latency), eight CPU threads, unaltered contiguous PCM and fresh speaker-cache per case. It exports native processor speaker intervals as case-local RTTM; source labels are evaluation-only. It records runtime, pinned weights, effective streaming config, input/prediction hashes, forward count and compute times in prediction provenance. This is an actual local sanity baseline, not a paid-provider or comprehensive leaderboard comparison.

## Soniox and Qwen comparison

[Corrected output-segment comparison](provider_comparison.md) and [machine-readable evidence](provider_comparison.json) contain four Soniox arms, Qwen realtime, and the retained Nemotron baseline. All **35/35 cloud case/arm runs** are now complete, plus seven retained Nemotron cases. Soniox's 28 stored complete responses were reprojected and rescored without new provider calls; their original JSON bytes remain unchanged. A fresh Qwen `brief_interjections` run sent the full 120 s in one Beijing session and received `session.finished`, completing Qwen **7/7** without changing its previous six results. Failed attempts remain preserved and excluded from scoring.

Provider execution, settings, conversion diagnostics, resource cleanup and recovery commands are documented separately:

- [Soniox](providers/soniox/execution_report.md): continuous, forced-six-second finalization, app-equivalent VAD/SmartTurn segmentation, and whole-file async.
- [Qwen](providers/qwen/execution_report.md): seven completed cases, the successful brief-only recovery, and retained failed-attempt/TLS diagnostics. The recovered case has DER 76.62%, with 11 native speaker IDs against four reference speakers. Six-primary pooled DER is 72.88%; the dependent far-field pair is 79.81%, scored separately.

The old 60-ms token-pulse RTTMs, four scores and four provenance files are preserved under [the non-primary baseline archive](providers/soniox/token_pulse_baseline/README.md), with hashes. They are no longer the canonical Soniox hypothesis or a valid basis for a general voice-recognition ranking. Current SDK groups and source projections are in `providers/soniox/sdk_output/`; current receipts declare `hypothesis.method=soniox_sdk_speaker_segments` and record the pinned package, bridge and derived-artifact hashes. Embedded projection metadata in old raw result JSON is historical, not the current receipt.

The corrected pooled Soniox DER is 48.27% continuous, 70.28% forced, 68.15% app-segmented and 48.27% async, versus old pulse values 72.34%, 89.21%, 86.66% and 72.65%. The repair reduces misses but increases false alarm and confusion; it does **not** improve the underlying model or establish acoustic speech completeness. The comparison reports all three error components, the old/new measurements, per-case scores and separate microphone pair. It does not reinstate the withdrawn general provider ranking.

To reproduce the offline Soniox conversion, use Node/npm and the existing application Python environment used by the original Soniox probe:

```sh
npm ci --prefix experiments/ami_benchmark/providers/soniox/sdk --no-audit --no-fund
python experiments/ami_benchmark/providers/soniox/run.py --convert-all
python experiments/ami_benchmark/providers/soniox/receipts.py
```

No Soniox client or API request is created by the SDK grouping bridge. `run.py` live conversion and saved-output conversion use the same corrected adapter. Run the standard scorer above for each `providers/soniox/predictions/ARM` directory to update `providers/soniox/scores/ARM.json` if predictions change; the execution report records all four actual scorer invocations.

Rebuild the complete comparison offline under Linux/WSL:

```sh
experiments/ami_benchmark/.venv/bin/python experiments/ami_benchmark/compare_providers.py
```

This checks input, native-result and prediction digests, rejects the obsolete Soniox projection method, and reproduces every complete-arm score. The default strict command now succeeds with all seven Qwen predictions and their full provenance; no incomplete-mode exception is needed. `--allow-incomplete` remains available only for explicitly declared partial Qwen evidence and cannot supply a missing case or aggregate. `score.py` still requires all seven predictions; standard DER, references, UEM and the existing Qwen/Nemotron interval-construction policies are unchanged.

Provider JSON, JSONL and RTTM evidence has byte-preserving Git attributes so line-ending conversion cannot silently invalidate retained digest chains. Existing benchmark audio, references, Nemotron output and production application behavior are unchanged.
